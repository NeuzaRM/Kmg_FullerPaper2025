## Scripts for the paper:
Matias NR, Gallicchio L, Lu D, Kim J, Perez J, Detweiler A, Lu C, Bolival B, Fuller MT. A cell type specific surveillance complex represses cryptic promoters during differentiation in an adult stem cell lineage. (2025) bioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2025.02.25.640250). Accepted for publication at Genes & Development. 


All sequencing data were submitted to GEO with the accession numbers: GSE301549, GSE301552, GSE301635, GSE301637, GSE301639, GSE301641. 



  - I'm keeping the scripts as they are for record keeping, despite the following caveats:

  - ... some scripts were run on our high performance computing cluster (SLURM)  
  
  - ... some scripts (mostly R and RM) were run locally

Scripts were divided in 8 folders. 
Each folder contains a Data folder, with some of the important output files.
Please check individual README files for details on each pipeline.

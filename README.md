# Kmg_FullerPaper2025

## Scripts for the paper from: 

UCSC public session:



  - I'm keeping the scripts as they are for record keeping, despite the following caveats:

  - ... some scripts were run on our high performance computing cluster (SLURM)  
  
  - ... some scripts (mostly R and RM) were run locally

Scripts were divided in 8 folders. 
Each folder contains a Data folder, with some of the important output files.
Please check individual README files for details on each pipeline.
